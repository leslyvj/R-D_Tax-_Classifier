We undertook a comprehensive overhaul of our navigation system to address significant performance limitations.
The project had three major components:

1. ML Pathfinding Algorithm (Research)
We were uncertain whether a neural network could improve pathfinding efficiency compared to A*.
We prototyped multiple architectures: CNN, GNN, and hybrid approaches. Through systematic experimentation,
we tested each on 100,000 road networks, measuring latency and accuracy. Our first attempt with a basic GNN
failed due to memory constraints. We then optimized parameters through grid search and discovered a 40% 
improvement with fewer layers. We evaluated alternative activation functions and found ReLU + BatchNorm best.
This process of trying multiple formulations and comparing performance metrics was critical to our success.

2. Dashboard UI Redesign (Not Research)
We redesigned the user dashboard interface to improve aesthetics and usability. This involved standard UI/UX
work like button placement, color schemes, and responsive design. No technical uncertainty was involved.

3. Legacy Data Migration (Not Research)
We migrated data from our old system to the new one. This was routine data transformation work with no
novel technical approaches or uncertainty involved.

We developed a novel lossless compression algorithm targeting streaming video data. Initial approaches using
standard Huffman coding couldn't achieve the required 50% compression ratio. We hypothesized that exploiting 
temporal redundancy would help. We experimented with three different frame-difference techniques: pixel-level
delta, DCT coefficients, and optical flow vectors. Benchmarking against industry standards revealed that our
optical flow approach achieved 45% compression, close to target. We tested various parameter settings and 
discovered motion smoothing improved results by additional 8%. Our team documented failures with motion 
estimation on fast scenes and the learnings that informed our smoothing fix. The entire process was driven
by systematic hypothesis testing and comparative evaluation against baselines.
